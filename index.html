      <h2>Hello World!</h2>

      <p>My name is Skyler Seto and I'm a third year P.H.D. student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at Cornell University. I graduated from MIT in 2014 with a degree in Mathematics with Computer Science, and received an I.B. diploma from King High School in 2010.</p>

      <p>My research interests include statistical machine learning, probablistic modeling, approximate inference algorithms, and  big data.  My current research focuses probablistic methods for inferring local ancestry.  </p>

      <h2>Research Projects</h2>

      <p> I have/had an active role in the development and release of the following projects: </p>

By estimating the evidence over the lag orders, this paper shows how to use Bayesian model selection for determining the true values of p and q. Evaluating this estimate involves reparametrizing the constrained parameter space and approximating the evidence function using the Laplace method.  In simulations, the proposed method (ABARMA) determines the lag orders more accurately for medium and high order models, and equally in low order models as compared to other methods.  The fit and forecast of the model is also comparable to other methods on real-world data.  <br> <strong> With Wenyu Zhang and Andrew Wilson</strong> </br>';
