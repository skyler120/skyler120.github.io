      <h2>Hello World!</h2>

      <p>My name is Skyler Seto and I'm a second year P.H.D. student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at Cornell University. I graduated from MIT in 2014 with a degree in Mathematics with Computer Science, and received an I.B. diploma from King High School in 2010.</p>

      <p>My research interests include Machine learning, Data Science, Big Data, and Natural Language Processing.  My current research focuses on developing automated data mining and machine learning systems for car destination prediction problems.  </p>

      <h2>Research Projects</h2>

      <p> I have/had an active role in the development and release of the following projects: </p>

        <TR>
          <TD>Car Trip Destination Prediction</TD>
          <TD> Technological advances in storage paired with more frequent large scale data collection has resulted in massive datasets in many different domains.  This research develops an automated data science pipeline for organizing and condensing large database formats for machine learning prediction.   Using this framework, 750 GB of automobile trip data is organized and ongoing work is being conducted to predict trip destinations from a mixture of different car signals (such as time, GPS, temperature, radio, etc.)</TD>

          <TD>Caring on Reddit: The Linguistic Lives of Loyalists and Vagrants</TD>
          <TD>Online communities are open to users worldwide, and large websites attract millions of users, but not all of the users keep active in these communities.  In this study, Reddit users are  aggregated into two group, loyalists and vagrants, by their activity level, and linguistic differences are demonstrated between the two.  Through  simple activity indicators, such as word counts, coarse language models, and finer-grained word-level examination, we discover that the two types of users have different focuses and carry different roles in the online communities.

       <TR>
          <TD><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06747">Time Series Classification for Human Activity Recognition</a></TD>
          <TD> Accurate and computationally efficient means for classifying human activities have been the subject of extensive research efforts.  Most current research focuses on extracting complex features to achieve high classification accuracy. This research proposes a template selection approach based on Dynamic Time Warping, such that complex feature extraction and domain knowledge is avoided. The predictive capability of the algorithm is demonstrated to exceed conventional methods in many aspects.</TD>
       </TR>


       <TR>
          <TD><a href="files/RIPS.pdf">Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Systems</a></TD>
          <TD>A typical channel communication signal transmission and reception process mainly consists of five stages: encoding, modulation, channel, demodulation and decoding.  Equalization is the process of recovering the original signal from the received, noisy signal during the demodulation stage. This process can be difficult especially for low powered signals.  Modifying existing equalization algorithms, two new equalization algorithms are developed with comparable accuracy and efficiency.</TD>
       </TR>


       <TR>
          <TD><a href="files/Xiaotao_Skyler_poster.pdf">Bioinformatics Analysis of HDAC-Interacting Proteins</a></TD>
          <TD>Many proteins that have previously been described as protein modification enzymes represent only single members of protein complexes and only function properly together with other factors.  Using publicly available databases and bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, putative interacting proteins of eighteen human HDACs were identified by constructing a “round trip” between human HDACs and their interacting proteins through homologues in other species that are experimentally verified to interact.  Results not only confirmed many HDAC-interacting proteins previously identified by biochemical and cell biology methods, but also suggested hundreds of potential HDAC-interacting partners that escaped conventional methods of detection. </TD>

      <h2>Fun Projects</h2>

      <p> Additionally, I have contributed to smaller "fun" projects outside of research. I've linked a few of my favorites:

        <TR>
          <TD><a href="files/18.821 Paper 2.pdf">Dynamical Systems with Polygons</a></TD>
          <TD> <strong> 18.821 Project List Problem Statement: </strong> Consider a square, with a natural number at each endpoint. At the midpoint of each edge, write the absolute value |a − b| of the difference (a, b),  the numbers at the endpoints of each edge. Draw a smaller square connecting those midpoints, and repeat. The game stops if you get to (0, 0, 0, 0).  What are the lenghts of these games? What can one say about the maximum length of a game given initial bounds on the numbers at each endpoint?  In this paper, we solve this initial problem as well as other extensions.</TD>

          <TD><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/CMS/CMS.611/F13/AquaticEvolver.swf">Aquatic Evolver</a></TD>
          <TD>  In Aquatic Evolver, players guide an amoeba-like creature through an aquatic environment.  Players begin with a body and tentacle, and gain different appendages by fighting other amoeba-like creatures and evolving.  As players progress through the depths monsters get increasingly aggressive and powerful.  How far into the depths will you make it? </TD>

          <TD><a href="http://apark93.mit.edu/cardblocks/final/cardblocks/">Card Blocks (Prototype)</a></TD>
          <TD>  Card Blocks is a tetris-like puzzle video game in which players form blocks of numbers to earn points and fight their opponent.  Each Card is a number from 1-9. Blocks are sets of two or more cards with the same number or sets of three or more consecutive numbers aligned horizontally or vertically.   Once a block is formed, it immediately dissapears and reappears on the enemy's board in a random location.  Each block earns points.  You will win if you have the most points at the end of five minutes or if you can fill your opponent's board. </TD>

          <TD><a href="http://6.270.scripts.mit.edu/"> LEGO Robotics Competition </a></TD>
          <TD> 6.270 is a MIT class/competition where competitors design a fully autonomous LEGO robot to compete by navigating around a surface, recognizing enemy robots, manipulating game objects such as balls and gear boxes, and surviving three foot drop tests.  My team (Team 24 - Yoyac) placed second at the <a href= "http://webcast.amps.ms.mit.edu/i/institute/2012-2013/6.270/"> 2013 competition</a>. </TD>
